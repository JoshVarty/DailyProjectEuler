I liked that my solution operates as a single loop. 

I saw one solution that used the register keyword. When I looked up what that meant it seemed like the user wasn't using it properly.
Register Keyword: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3207018/register-keyword-in-c
It seems like it had more use with older compilers and these days has limited benefits (allegedly some value with macros?)

There were some algebraic solutions as well. 

	Eg. We could have quickly computed the sum of 1 -> 100 as an arithmetic series before squaring. This would move work
		out of our main loop.

I could've defined my own square() function instead of using cmath's pow(). I typically default to the library just because I can
usually guarantee anyone who reads my code will be more familiar with it than anything I'd define.
