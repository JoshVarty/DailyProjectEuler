I found this one relatively easy but it required a careful reading of the problem. I thought we were looking
for numbers under 1,000 instead of 10,000.

It's possible to calculate the sum in place without an extra iteration but I wanted to try using std::set.
It's kind of depressing using it after being spoiled by C#'s foreach for so long.

I'm not sure how much time I saved by caching results, but my approach seemed to work pretty quickly.
