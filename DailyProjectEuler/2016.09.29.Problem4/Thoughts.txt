I'm relatively happy with my solution but having looked at some others there are some changes I might make:
	- Some people use a mathematical approach for isPalindrome() similar to:

		bool isPalindrome(unsigned long int number)
		{
			unsigned long int tmp=number, invNumber=0;

			while (tmp)
			{
				invNumber = invNumber*10 + (tmp % 10);
				tmp /= 10;
			}
			return (invNumber == number ? true : false);
		}


	- Another optimization I liked was to start at 999 and work down. If I had used that approach then isPalindrome() would
	likely have been called fewer times because in general we'd have found the larger solutions first.
