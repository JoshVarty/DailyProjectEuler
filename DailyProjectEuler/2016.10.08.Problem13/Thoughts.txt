I solved this problem not by calculating JUST the first ten digits but instead by taking all digits into account. 
Apparently for this particular set of numbers you could have cheated and only added the initial digits, but this solution
doesn't generalize for other numbers (eg. All 9's)

I essentially just implemented logic for addition + carrying digits using arrays to hold the numbers.

This was probably the most painful problem I've done so far.

If I could redo this problem I would have implemented a BigInt class in order to get practice with classes n stuff in C++
