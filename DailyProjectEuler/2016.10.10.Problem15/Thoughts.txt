I originally tried to do this without the lookup and it ended up taking way too long. That said it's possible 
my program may have completed sooner than the extra time it took me to add a lookup.

I (still) don't know a good way to initialize 2D arrays to -1 so I just did it with a loop.
I've actually asked this question on SO before:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8204787/static-initialization-of-an-array-of-structs-in-c

Anyways with the lookup the problem was solved in less than a second and I'm pretty happy with it.

The solution 137846528820 is equivalent to 40 choose 20. 
TBH I understand the 40 portion but not the 20 part... I'll have to think about this some more.
