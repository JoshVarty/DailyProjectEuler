This problem was interesting to me because I was asked an almost identical problem when interviewing for an
internship at Khan Academy in 2012. I fumbled on the question and got stuck on edge cases and I ultimately 
did not receive an offer from them. So I took this as an opportunity for a sort of redemption.

I submitted the wrong answer twice for the following reasons:
	- I was calculating isLeapYear() incorrectly and had an extra for 1900
	- I assumed they wanted the Sundays on the 1st within 1900, but they wanted you to start counting in 1901

Moral of the story would be that it pays to read the question carefully, both to understand how leap years
should be calculated and what dates to count.

I saw a solution that coded the number of days in each month into an array and I preferred that to my big
if-else's.

Lots of people calculated the answers by hand or used date libraries so there wasn't much to pull from their
approaches.
