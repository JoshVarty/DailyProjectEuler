This was a pretty straightforward problem. The only optimization I made was to cache whether numbers were prime or not in an array. I'm not sure that this was useful.
The cache was so large that initializing it to 0 seemed to end up dominating runtime. I probably could have better estimated the size I needed instead of just making it INT32_MAX.

Only real thoughts:
	When refactoring a for-loop to do-while I accidentally introduced two declarations of a variable with the same name. Since 
	C++ allows variable shadowing there was no error but my program didn't work properly. I'll need to be more cognizant of this
	in the future.
