I messed this one up. For some reason I thought I should cache all of the fibionacci results in a lookup.
I then thought that I'd need to use unordered_map<string,string> despite the fact I could have at least
used unordered_map<int,string>.

This led me down a painful path of converting between int[] and string where I wasted a lot of time.

In the end my solution works but I barely feel comfortable putting this on a GitHub no one will check.
