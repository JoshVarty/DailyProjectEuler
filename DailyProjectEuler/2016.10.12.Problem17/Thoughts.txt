This was the least enjoyable problem I've attempted so far. However I learned a bunch about the
std::string class that I wasn't aware of before:
    - std::string cannot be null as it's not a pointer. Intution from other languages misled me.
    - Replace does not let you replace chars in a string with empty chars
    - The errors in C++ are frequently misleading. Mismatched parens cause misleading errors (like F#)
    
I could have changed my implementation to return numbers (character count) instead of strings and saved myself
the pain of having to work through the string stuff. However if my implementation had been incorrect I figured this
would make it hard to debug.

Many people used a pencil-and-paper approach whereby the computer was just a calculator.

I don't really like my approach but no one else's really jumped out at me either. I'm just glad to be done.

This problem made me miss C#.
