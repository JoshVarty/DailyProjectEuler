- I originally forgot about modulus for some reason and was considering trying something with integer division. I learned there's 
no explict integer division (\) operator in C++
- My solution felt sloppy but integer factorization is a pain in general. Most solutions I looked at also used an isPrime() function
- I saw a solution that used squares instead of square roots to calculate boundaries which seemed interesting if you were stranded
on a deserted island without your sqrt() function. 
- Once again I forgot to use unsigned int.
- My solution fails if the original number you give it is prime. That being said, the problem didn't ask for a general solution.
